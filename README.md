# spraycharles

## Overview
Low and slow password spraying tool, designed to spray on an interval over a long period of time.

Associated [blog post](https://www.sprocketsecurity.com/blog/how-to-bypass-mfa-all-day) by [@sprocket_ed](https://twitter.com/sprocket_ed) covering NTLM over HTTP, Exchange Web Services and spraycharles.

## Install

### Using pipx

You can use pipx to to install the spraycharles package into an isolated environment. First install pipx:

```bash
pip3 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Following this, install the package with the following command:

```bash
pipx install spraycharles
```

The spraycharles package will then be in your path and useable from anywhere.

Note that log and output CSV files are stored in a directory created in your users home folder with the name `.spraycharles`. These log and CSV files are dynamically created on runtime. These files are in the format: `target-host.timestamp.csv`.

See [usage](#usage) for instructions on how to specify an alternative location for your CSV file.

### Using Docker
Execute the following commands to build the spraycharles Docker container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tw1sm/spraycharles
cd spraycharles/extras
docker build . -t spraycharles
```

Execute the following command to use the spraycharles Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it -v ~/.spraycharles:/root/.spraycharles spraycharles -h
```

You may need to specify additional volumes based on where username a password lists are being stored.

Spraycharles also includes other submodules:

```
Usage: spraycharles [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  analyze  Analyze existing csv files.
  gen      Generate custom password lists from JSON file.
  modules List all the available spraying modules
  parse    Parse NTLM over HTTP and SMB endpoints to collect domain...
  spray    Low and slow password spraying tool.
```

See below for further information about these modules.

### Config File
It is possible to pre-populate command line arguments form a configuration file using the `--config` argument.

An example configuration file is listed below:

```python
usernames = '/tmp/users.txt'
passwords = '/tmp/passwords.txt'
output = 'mail.acme.com.csv'
module = 'owa'
host = 'mail.acme.com'
domain = 'ACME'
analyze = 'True'
attempts = '1'
interval = '30'
timeout = '25'
```

### Notifications
Spraycharles has the ability to issue notifications to Discord, Slack and Microsoft Teams following a potentially successful login attempt. This list of notification providers can augmented using the utils/notify.py script. For any of the potential notification agents, you must specify its name and a webhook URL.

It is best to specify this information using the configuration file to keep your command shorter:

```python
notify = 'slack'
webhook = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

Notifications sent to any of the providers will include the targeted hostname associated with the spraying job. This is expecially useful when spraying multiple targets at once using spraycharles.

### Examples
Basic usage (Office365)
```bash
spraycharles spray -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m Office365
```
Basic usage (non-Office365) with a single password, supplied via command line
```bash
spraycharles spray -u users.txt -H webmail.company.com -p Password123 -m owa
```
Attempt 5 logins per user every 20 minutes
```bash
spraycharles spray -u users.txt -H webmail.company.com -p passwords.txt -i 20 -a 5 -m owa
```
Usage with fireprox (Office365)
```bash
spraycharles spray -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m office365 -f abcdefg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonawms.com
```
Spray host over SMB with 2 attempts per user every hour
```bash
spraycharles spray -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m Smb -H 10.10.1.5 -a 2 -i 60
```

## Utilities
Spraycharles is packaged with some additional utilities to assist with spraying efforts.

### Generating Custom Spray Lists
The spraycharles "gen" subcommand will generate a password list based off the specifications provided in extras/list_elements.json

```bash
spraycharles gen extras/list_elements.json custom_passwords.txt
```

### Extracting Domain from NTLM over HTTP and SMB
The spraycharles parse subcommand will extract the internal domain from both NTLM over HTTP and SMB services using a command similar to the one listed below.


```bash
spraycharles parse https://example.com/ews
```

### Analyzing the results CSV file
The `analyze` submodule can read your output CSV and determine response lengths that are statistically relevant. With enough data, it should be able to pull successful logins out of your CSV file. This is not the only way to determine successful logins, depending on your target site, and I would still recommend checking the data yourself to be sure nothing is missed. For SMB, it will simply find entries with NTSTATUS codes that indicate success.

```bash
spraycharles analyze myresults.csv
```

## Disclaimer
This tool is designed for use during penetration testing; usage of this tool for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state and federal laws. Developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse of this program.

## Development
Git pre-commit is used to maintain code quality and ensure uniform formatting. To begin developing with spraycharles:

```bash
pip3 install poetry
git clone https://github.com/Tw1sm/spraycharles
cd spraycharles
poetry install
```

Tests for the spraycharles project are written and stored in the tests directory. A more extensive testing harness is coming soon!
